Predicting preterm births using both cervical data and EHG signals.
Introduction- Preterm birth, defined as a pregnancy ending before 37 weeks, is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity and has significant health concerns for the infant. Preterm labor can be accurately predicted early in pregnancy, which is important since it can improve outcomes for pregnancies at risk and preventative care. The goal of this project is to create a predictive model for preterm birth by examining datasets that comprise measurements of cervical length taken during pregnancy and Electromyography (EHG) signals.

Using cervical length data or EHG signals, different machine learning methods have been used in previous studies to predict premature birth. For EHG-based predictions, methods including decision trees, bias functions, sparse autoencoders, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and others have been employed. Similar techniques have been used to analyze cervical length data: support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and feedforward networks for image classification. 

In order to improve the prediction of preterm birth, we provide a unique method in this work that integrates cervical length measures with EHG signals. Our goal is to develop a more reliable and accurate model for identifying pregnancies at risk of preterm delivery by combining this extensive dataset with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, as well as parameter tuning and Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.
